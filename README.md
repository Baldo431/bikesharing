# Bike Trip Analysis

## Overview
### Purpose
Provide invenstors with data visualizaions, using Tableau, that proves that a bicycle ride sharing business in Des Moines, Iowa is a solid business proposal. Existing data from a similar business, the Citi Bike program in New York City, will be utilized to understand how the bike-sharing business actually works. In particular, this analysis will focus on how bike trips (quanity and length) relate to other factors.

## Summary
Based on the data anlyzed the following recommendations can be made:
- The target audience should largely be young male riders.
- The business model should focus on growing subscribers as they ride more often.
- Logistics (availability of bikes, repair frequency, etc.) should revolve around bikes being ridden for less than an hour.
- The business should capitalize on demand outside of typical work hours during the workweek and throughout daylight hours outside of the work week.

In order to make a better informed decision, the following visualizations are suggested for future analysis:
- Map visualization showing where different genders or user types (shown by color) tend to ride bikes and for how long (shown by marker size).
- Line or area visualization showing number of bike rides by birthyear.
